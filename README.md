My project is a book blog called TalkBooks. I created this blog for people, like myself, who love to read and want good recommendations. 
For my 3 required features; 
1. I added a chart by chartjs to show users the pricing of the book in different stores. which is located under the "A Court of Throns and Roses" book or in the book1.html; 
2. I added countdown watch to countdown the days until the release of the movie "It Ends with Us' which is located on the home screen in the index.html;
3. I add an API search bar to search the authors of the books I recommended and the other books they have written, which is located on the home screen in the index.html
For other features not required but added in the project is, youtube video located in the book1.html, a coursel located in one the front page in index.html, and a menu toggle.
This project is not a complete project, but plan to complete to use for future job opportunities.
